TLM AMBA Bridges
----------------
Several TLM AMBA bridges are implemented in this repository. The purpose of
these bridges is to translate transactions to/from TLM Generic Payload
to/from AMBA wire signaling.

TLM Generic Payload transactions do not carry enough detail to express
some of the concepts used by the AXI protocol. To model these, we've
added an optional extension called Generic Attributes that describes
common transaction attributes in a bus protocol agnostic way. Well,
in reality they are a little biased towards AMBA but that is the intent.
The extension can carry attributes like a Secure/Non-Secure bit, a
transaction ID and more. These attributes are optional to use by
any TLM interconnect component so they can flow around even through
components that are not aware of them. Once they reach one of our
bridges, they attributes will be used to synthesize AXI traffic.

Principles
----------
P1. The bridges target the LT TLM programming style.
Unless we have a strong reason to, we try to stick to the LT programming
style.

P2. Bridges are transparent
Generally, a bridge should to the largest extent possible be transparent.
This is because what we are actually trying to implement, does not really
exist on real hardware.
Architecturally we should not modify transactions in ways such as buffering,
caching or upsizing. Instead, the bridge should aim at mapping GP's and
AXI signaling to each other as directly as possible. Still, in some cases
TLM transactions and RTL have so different semantics that the flows need
to be altered.

TLM-to-AXI
----------
The TLM to AXI bridge implements the translation between TLM Generic Payloads
coming from a TLM Initiator and bridges them over to AXI signaling as an
AXI Master.


                     .----------.
  TLM target socket | TLM-2-AXI |
  <---------------->|  Bridge   |
     b_transport()  '-----------'
                         /|\
                          | AXI Master port
                          |
                          |           AXI Slave port .-----------.
                           `------------------------>| AXI Slave |
                                                     |___________|


The flow is basically that a TLM module sends traffic onto the bridges
target_socket calling our b_transport() function. At this point we
receive a TLM Generic Payload potentially with a Generic Attributes extension.

Timing
------
The generic payload transaction may already be anottated with a delay.
Since we will translate this LT style transaction into RTL signal
wiggling that needs to wait for signal changes, we need to get rid of
the anottated delay by waiting for it and setting it to zero.

Multiple Outstanding transactions
---------------------------------
Our slave port's b_transport() can be called by multiple threads
simultaneously. This means that multiple masters, or even a single
multi-threaded master issue multiple outstanding transactions
towards our bridge. In order to fully utilize the pipelined nature
of the AXI protocol, we need to utilize this multi-threaded
TLM programming style to fill the various pipeline stages of the
bridge.

This is achieved by implementing the various phases in
separate threads and by using FIFOs to decouple the caller and
the various phases from each other.

Transaction Ordering
--------------------
The TLM-to-AXI side of things can rely on the fact that previous
components have not broken the AXI ordering rules. So what we need
to make sure is that we don't reorder transactions as they come in,
so we won't. We could in theory try to optimize the traffic, but
we shouldn't according to our principle P1, so we don't.

AXI-to-TLM
----------
The purpose of the AXI-to-TLM bridge is to translate AXI transactions
into TLM Generic Payloads and thereafter propagate these to TLM targets.
It acts as an AXI slave on the AXI side and as a TLM initiator on the
TLM side. AXI transactions received on the AXI slave port are converted
into TLM Generic Payloads containing AXI protocol details inside a TLM
Generic Attributes extension. The TLM Generic Payloads are thereafter
forwaded through the bridge's TLM initiator socket with b_transport to
TLM targets. The TLM Generic Payload response status after performing
the transaction is translated and propagated back to the AXI master in
the AXI response.

                             .----------.
                             | AXI-2-TLM |   TLM target socket
                             |  Bridge   |<-------------->
                             '-----------'    b_transport()
                                  /|\
                                   | AXI Slave port
                                   |
  .------------.  AXI master port  Â¦
  | AXI Master |<------------------+
  |____________|


Timing
------
The generic payload transaction may be anottated with a delay at the
TLM target. The AXI-to-TLM bridge models this delay by waiting on it
before generating an AXI response for the AXI transaction to the AXI
master.

Multiple Outstanding transactions
---------------------------------
The AXI-to-TLM bridge supports multiple outstanding transactions. This
is achieved by implementing the various phases of the transaction in
separate threads and by using FIFOs to decouple the phases from each
other. Every TLM transaction on the TLM side is also executed in it's
own thread, this for being able to model individual transaction delays.

Transaction Ordering
--------------------
The AXI-to-TLM follows the AXI transaction ordering rules. It processes
transactions with the same transaction id or with overlapping addresses
in order. This is achieved by only executing one TLM transaction at a
time for transactions requiring to be kept ordered.
